		<h1>It's Soldering Time!</h1>
		<p>Now that we have all our ingredients. Lets stick some of it together. First, we have to add our
        stabilizers. Because pictures will not do enough justice, 
		<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_1_5oBVMqo&t=231s" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;"> here</a> 
		is video that is clear on where and how to mount your stabilizers correctly. The 
        installation begins at 8 minutes and 15 seconds into the video. After the stabilizers are 
        mounted, lay the plate directly on top of the pcb and then putting in the switches. Make sure
        to align the pins correctly with their respective holes as shown below</p>

	<p>These pins poking out on the back of the pcb now need to be soldered. Brandon Taylor does a solid
        <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ujz-noZKk" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">guide</a> on soldering and makes 
        the process less daunting then it should be. As mentioned in the video, it is key to make sure
        you are in a ventilated area and consider wearing safety goggles in the event of a freak accident.
        And finally, make sure to only apply heat on the pad for about 2-4 seconds max to avoid
        damaging the pcb. Although they are built to withstand immense heat, it is generally not in your
        best interest to limit test on an expensive piece of tech.
