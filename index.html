			<p>Many of us have jobs that require us to sit in front of a computer screen using
				our keyboards for hours. So wouldn't it be nice to have a custom keyboard that is
				catered to your personality and sound preference? There is a diverse set of keycaps, 
				sounds, and feel that can make your typing experience that much better on a daily basis.
				However, be careful of the rabbit hole custom keyboards can create as entry level boards 
				can easily reach $100. Before we get into the nitty gritty details of building process,
				if you ever hear of an endgame keyboard, that is false. There is no endgame.

		Although most 65% keyboards use about 67 switches, it is recommended to always 
		buy slightly more. This is in the case that you accidentally break a pin off the switch or lose one.
